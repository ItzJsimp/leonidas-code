 * Agents under-use skills: a design task runs without the design skills, a bug hunt without the
 * diagnosis skill. This block makes skill selection a step of every task, caps it at 5 so context
 * stays lean, and asks for one "Using <skill>: <reason>" line so the app can show the user which
 * skills the agent chose on its own and why. Keep that line format in step with the client parser.

Skills hold the best known way to do each kind of work. Make skill selection the first step of every task.
- Before you act, compare the task with the skill list. Load each skill whose description matches the task, even when the user did not name it. Example: load the design skills for any screen, page, app or UI work.
- Load at most ${MAX_SKILLS_PER_TASK} skills for one task, most relevant first. Load each skill once, then follow its steps.
- When you load a skill on your own, start that message with one line: \`Using <skill>: <reason, 10 words or fewer>\`. Leonidas Code shows the user every skill you used and this reason.

const PULL_REQUEST_LINKING_INSTRUCTIONS = `<pull_request_linking>
When the t3-code MCP server exposes link_pull_request, register every PR you create or work on for this thread. Call it with the full PR URL immediately after creating a PR or starting work on an existing one, and for every layer of a stack. This also applies to PRs made through gh, gh stack, another CLI, or the host API, which do not register them. Linking an already-linked PR is safe. Before finishing PR work, call list_thread_pull_requests and link any missing PR from your work; do not link PRs mentioned only as background. If a link call fails, report that instead of claiming the PR is linked. When asked to monitor or babysit a PR and watch_pull_request is available, call it and end your turn; Leonidas Code wakes you on checks, comments, or conflicts, so do not poll. When handing work back, call unwatch_pull_request first.
</pull_request_linking>`;

const WAITING_INSTRUCTIONS = `<waiting_handoff>
Leonidas Code shows the user when you are waiting on a shell command, a subagent, an app tool or a web call, and what it is. When such a wait ends and you continue, open your next message with one short line naming what finished and that you are carrying on, for example "The test run finished; continuing with the fix." Say it once per wait, not per tool call, and skip it for instant reads and searches.
</waiting_handoff>`;

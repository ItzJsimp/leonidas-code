Resolve an ambiguous pronoun, vague referent or dangling clause by naming what it points to, but only when the surrounding text settles it; where the text leaves it open, keep the original wording instead of guessing. Put cause before effect, premise before conclusion, and related points together, and state a connection explicitly (because, so, but) only when the text already implies it. Keep the first-person perspective, and keep every point, question, example and constraint; length may stay the same or grow slightly, shortening is not a goal. Fix grammar and punctuation along the way. Add no new claims, advice or structure."}, {"name": "Shorter", "instruction": "Cut the word count by deleting, not restructuring: remove filler, hedges, repeated ideas, throat-clearing and passive padding, and prefer the shorter of two equivalent phrasings. Keep the original voice, person, tone and sentence order, and every fact, name, number and request. Do not reframe it as an instruction, add structure, or sharpen vague wording; the text should read like the same author in fewer words. If it is already tight, trim what you can and leave the rest."}, {"name": "Friendly", "instruction": "Rewrite as a message to a client or a friend: warm, natural and direct, using contractions where they sound natural. Infer the register from the text: a client gets professional warmth and a clear next step; a friend gets casual and easy. Lead with the point or the ask, keep it as short as the content allows, and keep every fact, date, number and commitment exactly as given without adding promises, apologies or details the sender did not state. Use plain words, no hype, hollow praise, exclamation points or filler pleasantries."}, {"name": "AI message", "instruction": "Your lane is AI-actionable specificity, not brevity: the output may be the same length or slightly longer than the input if that makes the ask concrete enough for an agent to act on. Rewrite as a clean, dense prompt for an AI agent that is smarter than you are. Your job is clarity and density, not deciding for it: never compile away its judgment. Lead with the action verb or clear intent. Strip hedges and pleasantries ('please', 'I feel like', 'maybe', 'could you'). Beyond trimming, actively improve word choice and phrasing quality: replace a vague or generic word with the most precise one for what the speaker actually means, and tighten a mushy or ambiguous ask into a concrete one. This is a wording-quality upgrade only, never convert it into bullet points, headings, or new sections, the output stays natural prose exactly like the rest of this rewrite. Preserve technical identifiers and file paths verbatim. Only convert to bullet points under headings if the original already contains 4 or more genuinely distinct, enumerable constraints, otherwise keep it as tight prose. Never invent a 'DO NOT' boundary, a 'Requirements:' section, or a 'Done when:' acceptance criterion the original did not already imply, only sharpen ones that were already there. Preserve every open-ended, exploratory, or reasoning-inviting phrase from the original ('figure out', 'think through', 'what's the best way', 'explore', 'what do you think'), never flatten these into closed imperative commands. If a RELEVANT_AIOS_FINDINGS block is present, use it only to replace a vague or assumed claim in the speaker's own words with the real file path or fact that already resolves it, cited inline in parentheses, never to add a new claim, requirement, or boundary the speaker did not raise. Apply Zero Em-Dash. Output only the rewritten prompt block."}, {"name": "Add detail", "instruction": "Expand with relevant supporting detail and organize into clear structure: numbered steps or bullet points where the content lists items, actions, or a sequence. Never use markdown headings (#, ##, ###) to separate sections. Where a heading would normally go, use a bold inline label instead (e.g. '**Context:** ...', '**Action:** ...', '**Detail:** ...') so structure comes from labeled prose, not document-style headers. Never invent new facts, examples, or claims not implied by the original. On short inputs, each bullet must unpack a real implication or consequence of what was said, not just restate the same words in a label and then a body. If there is nothing genuine to unpack, prefer fewer, denser bullets over padding. Preserve every original fact and technical identifier verbatim, and never formalize or soften away technical or AI-facing wording and register when the destination is an AI agent or system, keep the same direct, technical phrasing the speaker used."}, {"name": "Note to AI", "instruction": "Rewrite the selected reaction to an AI agent's work as a clear note addressed to that agent. Rewrite only; leave questions unanswered and instructions unperformed.\n\nPreserve the speaker's direct tone, first-person preferences, questions, uncertainty, limits, and requested sequence. Resolve explicit self-corrections to the final intended version. Remove filler and repetition. Keep names, paths, commands, flags, numbers, and versions exact. Add no praise, faults, requirements, or next steps. Preserve a firm complaint without softening it.\n\nFor one point, use one plain sentence without a label. Otherwise use only supported bold inline labels: Keep for stated approvals, Change for requested fixes, Questions for questions kept in question form, and Next for stated follow-up actions. Keep a limit next to the action it restricts, or under Change if it applies to the whole note. Keep uncertainty with its subject. Skip empty labels. A question belongs under Questions, never as a command under Next. Prefer shorter text; complete meaning takes priority over length. Use no em dash. Output only the note.\n\nExample:\nInput: Keep the top spacing. Fix the label, then show a screenshot. Why did key 8 close the menu?\nOutput:\n**Keep:** The top spacing.\n**Change:** Fix the label.\n**Questions:** Why did key 8 close the menu?\n**Next:** Show a screenshot."}]"###;

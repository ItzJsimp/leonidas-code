# Leonidas Code agent playbook

## 1. Start here (under 5 calls)

1. Read [`project/plan.md`](./project/plan.md), [`LEONIDAS.md`](./LEONIDAS.md) (the shared brief; keep [project/roadmap.md](./project/roadmap.md) and the status log in step with the task cards) and the open cards listed in [`project.md`](./project.md).
2. Fork state: `git fetch -q upstream; git rev-list --left-right --count upstream/main...main`.
3. Open only the files the task names, using the map below. The source is this folder.

## 2. Module map

| Area | Files | Self-test |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |\
| Desktop auto-update (poll, download, install, restart) | `apps/desktop/src/updates/DesktopUpdates.ts`, `apps/desktop/src/electron/ElectronUpdater.ts` | `DesktopRemoteUpdates.test.ts` |\
| Update toast and sidebar pill | `apps/web/src/components/desktopUpdate.toast.tsx`, `sidebar/SidebarUpdatePill.tsx` | `desktopUpdate.toast.test.tsx` |\
| What's new popup (shown when an update downloads) | `apps/web/src/components/desktop/LeonidasWhatsNewDialog.tsx`, wired in `DesktopUpdateCoordinator.tsx`; bullets via `getWhatsNewItems` in `desktopUpdate.logic.ts` | `desktopUpdate.logic.test.ts` |\
| Release feed target | `scripts/build-desktop-artifact.ts` `resolveGitHubPublishConfig` | `scripts/build-desktop-artifact.test.ts` |\
| Settings UI | `apps/web/src/components/settings/` | n/a |\
| Local mock update server | `pnpm start:mock-update-server` (`scripts/mock-update-server.ts`) | n/a |\

## 3. Data sources: shape, cost, traps

| Source          | Reached by                                                                                                                   | Latency                                     | Trap                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Update feed     | GitHub Releases of the repo named in `T3CODE_DESKTOP_UPDATE_REPOSITORY` or `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` at build time                 | 4 minute poll (`AUTO_UPDATE_POLL_INTERVAL`) | Baked in at build: an official T3 install keeps updating from `pingdotgg` until replaced by our build. Private repo needs a token in the app. |
| Public download | `releases/latest/download/Leonidas-Setup.exe` on `ItzJsimp/leonidas-code`, a fixed-name copy that `team-release.yml` uploads | n/a                                         | The versioned `Leonidas-Code-<v>-x64.exe` name changes every release; give users only the fixed link. Unsigned, so SmartScreen shows once.    |
| Update channel  | Derived from version string: `-nightly.YYYYMMDD.N` is nightly, else latest                                                   | n/a                                         | Updates whose channel does not match the selected one are ignored silently; version our builds as plain semver (`1.0.<run_number>`).          |

## 4. The cheap build and verify loop

1. Updater logic: run the updater tests in `apps/desktop` (fast, no build).
2. Toast flow end to end: `pnpm start:mock-update-server` plus a mock-updates desktop build, before touching CI.
3. Real proof: push to `main`, wait for the release, confirm the toast on the other machine.
4. First-run starter skills: `node scripts/verify-starter-skills.ts --live` installs all of them into a fresh temp folder and checks both roots plus Claude Code and Codex loading (about 8 s, one haiku call). `--list <folder>` audits any AIOS folder.
5. Which skills Codex sees in a folder, free and with no model call: `codex debug prompt-input` run there (skills are listed as `(file: rN/<name>/SKILL.md)`).
6. Web typecheck: from `apps/web`, `../../node_modules/.bin/vp run typecheck` (about 13 s). `npx tsgo` and a local `tsc` bin do not exist.
7. Server boot smoke, no install needed: `node scripts/smoke.mjs --runtime "<install>/Leonidas Code.exe" --entry "<install>/resources/server.asar/apps/server/dist/bin.mjs"` (about 8 s, fresh temp home). With an install, plain `node scripts/smoke.mjs`. It fails on a hung server (the 0.62.0 bug).

## 5. Gotchas (the ones that bite first)

Full list and session notes: [project/agent-gotchas.md](./project/agent-gotchas.md). Search it before touching updater, release, rebrand, worktree, build-preflight or quota code.

- **`gh` defaults to upstream in this fork:** `gh release list` with no `-R` reads `pingdotgg/t3code`. Always pass `-R ItzJsimp/leonidas-code`.
- **A push to `main` ships a release to both machines:** changes stay local commits until Jake says push.
- **Rebrand scope rule:** change user-visible names only; leave `@t3tools/*`, `T3CODE_*`, the `~/.t3` folder and app id `com.t3tools.t3code`, or threads orphan and installs duplicate.
- **No `vp` on PATH:** run `node_modules/.bin/vp test run <files>` from the repo.
- **The main checkout is shared with live agents:** another session may be committing here every few seconds. Never `git switch`/`git checkout -b` (its commits land on your branch) and never `git stash` (an old `stash@{0}` exists and `pop` applies it). Commit by explicit path with `git commit --only -- <paths>`; for a baseline, compare error lists instead of stashing.
- **A dev server for this checkout may already be running:** `vp run dev` then refuses. Start yours with `--home-dir <temp folder>` (own ports and data) and stop only the PID you captured (`/proc/<pid>/winpid`, then `taskkill //T`).
- **Fresh worktrees need an install first:** `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` (about 7.5 minutes) before any check. Worktrees on D: stall; use `C:/lcw`.
- **A commit that hangs is usually the hook:** let `vp fmt` finish; never bypass it.
- **MCP service test fixtures are partial records:** `OrchestratorMcpService.test.ts` casts runs without `startedAt`/`completedAt`. New code that reads run or turn fields must guard with `== null`, or 7 unrelated tests fail.
- **The main checkout cannot commit when its install is partial:** the `vp` pre-commit hook fails (code 127, or vite.config cannot load `vitest`). Commit from an installed worktree under `C:/lcw`; a PATH borrow of another worktree's `vp` does not work.
- **Server typecheck has existing errors** in unrelated test files (`aiosDetect.test.ts`, `relativeImportExtensions.test.ts`). Filter the output to your changed paths instead of reading the total.

## 6. Why it is this way

- **Native tasks and release planning:** Leonidas owns new tasks; Todoist supplied public interaction references. Agent execution requires explicit delegation. Existing AIOS cards and GitHub sharing remain compatible. Release scope lives in [`project-roadmap.json`](./project-roadmap.json); V1.0 remains an explicitly approved public launch.
- **Roadmap task identity:** Imported briefs carry a durable `Roadmap key:` in their descriptions. Renaming or moving a task must not reimport it. Use the shared `observeResize` helper for map connectors; raw ResizeObserver callbacks fail scoped lint.

- **Reuse electron-updater over a git-pull updater:** installed apps cannot `git pull`; the existing GitHub Releases path needs only a CI workflow. Card: [`t3-code-push-to-update-release-pipeline`](../../tasks/t3-code-push-to-update-release-pipeline.md).
- **Thin rebrand layer:** every branding touch makes `upstream/main` merges harder. Card: [`t3-code-rebrand`](../../tasks/t3-code-rebrand.md).

## 7. Session notes

- **2026-10-16:** Task board perf (branch `perf/task-scan`, worktree `C:/lcw/task-board-v2`): `aiosCardReader.ts` watches each card folder and serves the last scan; call `cardReader.invalidate()` after any card write. The task table renders through LegendList (`flattenGroups` in `taskRows.ts`); board columns page at `COLUMN_PAGE`. Fixture: `node C:/lcw/task-perf/make-fixture.mjs` (600 real cards + project symlinks). Dev pairing: `node apps/server/src/bin.ts auth pairing create --base-dir <home> --json`, field `credential`. `preview_resize` can fail with ECONNRESET; reopen the tab and retry.
- **2026-10-16:** Subagents (ADR-0082) live in `apps/server/src/subagents/` (spec parser with `extends`, spawn tiers, `SpawnApprovals` broker, Studio catalog) and `apps/web/src/components/subagents/`; starters in `packages/shared/src/subagentStarters/`. Branch `feat/subagent-spawn-path`, worktree `C:/lcw/subagents`. Studio data needs an AIOS root: start the dev server with `LEONIDAS_AIOS_ROOT=<folder with tasks/>`. Code that holds `\n` escapes must go through Write or Edit, not a Bash heredoc.
- **2026-10-16:** Opt-in usage analytics slice 1 (`apps/web/src/lib/usageAnalytics/`, `components/usageAnalytics/`, commit `24d1511edc`): PostHog EU, random install ID, consent dialog, 5 events. Key via `VITE_POSTHOG_KEY` (`apps/web/.env.local`, CI var `POSTHOG_PROJECT_KEY`). Browser panel default profile shows a blank page (HTTP 431); use the incognito profile. Slice 2 plan: `handoff-docs/2026-10-16-usage-analytics-slice-2.md`.
- **2026-10-15:** Providers page is now accounts grouped by service (`ProviderAccountGroups.tsx`, `providerAccounts.logic.ts`); the full editor opens only in the Settings sheet. Claude installs from `ClaudeInstallation.ts` (official installer) and the driver also searches `~/.local/bin`. Mint a dev pairing token with `node apps/server/src/bin.ts auth pairing create --base-dir <home> --json`.
- **2026-10-15:** Task completion celebration slice 1: `TaskBoardService.completions` (last 20, `SubscriptionRef`) streams over `taskBoard.subscribeCompletions` to `apps/web/src/components/taskCelebration/`. Board writes announce in `persist`; AIOS card writes announce in `cardUpdate`. Hand edits to card files do not announce yet. A toast lasts 2.5 s: verify it with a MutationObserver on `[aria-label=Notifications]` (the region has no `role` attribute).
- **2026-10-15:** Task board reader (`readAiosTasks`, `aiosCards.ts`) also reads `projects/<slug>/<child>/tasks` when `<child>` has its own `.git` (Goo Busters GB cards). GB words `doing`, `later`, `cut` and priority `P0` to `P3` map in `statusFromCard` and `priorityFromCard`. `findCardFile` searches the game repo, and `applyCardPatch` writes GB words (`doing`, `P0`, unquoted) for cards with `owner` and `system`.

- 2026-10-15: boot smoke gate `scripts/smoke.mjs` added to `team-release.yml`; proved on the original 0.62.0 `server.asar` (fails, "request hung") and the current build (passes, 7.6 s). `project add` falls back to offline silently; the smoke checks `server-runtime.json` still exists to prove the live path.
- 2026-10-14: fixed-name `Leonidas-Setup.exe` added to every release (`team-release.yml`, commit `5de80b185c`) as the one beginner download link; Scribe still has 0 releases, so dictation is not installable from a link.
- 2026-10-14: skill folders in the `/` menu (`packages/client-runtime/src/skillFolders.ts`, `apps/web/src/components/chat/composerSkillFolders.logic.ts`, `settings/SkillFoldersEditor.tsx`), commits `e518535038` and `b0e9835b08`; checked live in Claude, 97 flat rows became 9 folders. Open: AIOS mirror file, category and source for Codex skills.
- 2026-10-14: delegated task status returns a provider-reported `usage` block (`apps/server/src/mcp/delegatedTaskUsage.ts`, commit `c0efa878cf`); harness-gates card 1 of 4. Cards 2 to 4 build on it.
- 2026-10-14: AIOS Home on the Command tab (`taskBoard.home`, `aiosHome.ts`, `AiosHomeCard.tsx`), verified live on 583 cards; Home build 1 ms, shared card scan 92 ms warm is the next cost to cut.
- 2026-10-14: starter skills verified 22/22 in both roots for Claude Code and Codex; `SKILL_ROOTS` now lives in `skillPacks.ts` so the wizard and the verifier share it.

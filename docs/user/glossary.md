# Words we use

Leonidas Code and Leonidas Scribe use one word for one thing. This list is the source for every label, message and tooltip. When you write text a user can see, use the word in the first column. Do not use the words in the last column.

Code names (`thread`, `providerInstance`, `worktree`, `turn`, `T3CODE_*`, `@t3tools/*`, `~/.t3`) stay as they are. Only the text a user sees changes.

Git words stay, because the AI and GitHub use them: **branch** (a named line of changes), **commit** (one saved set of changes with a note), **pull request** (a request to add a branch to the main code). Each one gets a tooltip the first time a screen shows it.

## Rules for text a user sees

- Every button label starts with a verb: "Save", "Add AI account", "Open project".
- Every empty screen and every error says what to do next: "No chats yet. Type a message below to start one."
- Use "T3 Code" only to give credit to the upstream project (About and open source licenses).
- Write in ASD-STE100 short form: short active sentences, one idea each, simple tense.

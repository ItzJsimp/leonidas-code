# /review: spec match and code health

Engine: `review-two-axis` (a standards lane and a spec lane, in parallel). Added from Addy Osmani's code-review-and-quality: five axes and severity labels.

## Steps

1. **Pin the fixed point:** the commit before this work started.
2. **Load `review-two-axis`** and give it the spec card as the spec source.
3. **The standards lane covers 5 axes:** correctness, readability and simplicity, architecture, security, performance. Review the tests first, then the code.
4. **Label each finding:** Critical (blocks ship), Required (fix before ship), Optional, Nit. Give a `file:line` for each.
5. **Check the checks.** Make sure that the tests from `/build` test the behavior, not the implementation, and that they can fail.
6. **Act on the result.** Critical or Required findings: go back to `/build`. Readability findings: you can run `/code-simplify`.

## Done when

- No Critical or Required finding remains, and each lane reported a result.

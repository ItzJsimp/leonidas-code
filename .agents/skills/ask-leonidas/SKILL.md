## Agent Delegation Fitness Checklist

Before delegating work to a coding agent (connected providers or delegated child agents in Leonidas Code), ask these three questions. Your answer determines scope and preparation depth.

| Fitness Question                              | Example: Brainstorming                                                                                                 | Example: Execution                             | Example: Domain Knowledge                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Is this brainstorming or creative design?** | "What should our architecture look like?"                                                                              | "Implement feature X as specified."            | "Do we need TypeScript generics here?"                                                                   |
| **Requires upfront human thinking?**          | YES - Architect first, agent implements.                                                                               | NO - Agent owns it; you QA output.             | YES - You provide context first; agent executes.                                                         |
| **Expected depth of domain knowledge?**       | HIGH - You lead; agent supports.                                                                                       | MEDIUM - Spec is locked, agent executes.       | MEDIUM - Incorporate domain context in prompt.                                                           |
| **Best Approach**                             | Interview yourself (or use [`/grill-with-docs`](../grill-with-docs/SKILL.md)), lock the spec, then delegate execution. | Pass locked spec + context; let agent execute. | Provide full context (existing code, patterns, constraints); ask agent to implement within those bounds. |

**Gate rule:** If you're uncertain whether a task should be agent-led or human-led, default to human-led design + agent execution. Never hand off an unlocked spec or ambiguous requirements.

See [`raw/youtube/cole-medin/11-tiny-fixes/analysis.md`](../../../raw/youtube/cole-medin/11-tiny-fixes/analysis.md) (Tip #3: "Assess what should be delegated") for the reasoning behind this gate.

---

## The Core Builder Flow (Idea -> Ship)

Standard route for developing workspace features and scripts:

1. **Sharpen by Interview:** Run [`/grill-me`](../grill-me/SKILL.md), the model-invocable interview (chat-only), to conduct frontier interrogation rounds. Record hard architectural decisions under `decisions/` as ADRs and update [`CONTEXT.md`](../../../CONTEXT.md) via [`/domain-modeling`](../domain-modeling/SKILL.md). When the interview should write to canon as it goes, recommend the user-only [`/grill-with-docs`](../grill-with-docs/SKILL.md) (same engine plus ADR/glossary authoring; `disable-model-invocation: true`, so the router can recommend it but cannot invoke it). ADR-0066.
2. **Prototype Spikes (If Uncertain):** If an architectural question requires visual feedback or state spikes, ask the user to run [`/session-handoff`](../session-handoff/SKILL.md) (user-only invocation) to branch into an isolated scratch session, build the throwaway spike, and hand off back into the main idea thread.
3. **Decompose into Tasks:** Break specifications into testable vertical slices with blocking edges using [`/task-scoping`](../task-scoping/SKILL.md). Record tasks in [`tasks/`](../../../tasks/tasks-index.md) via [`/task-management`](../task-management/SKILL.md).
4. **Disciplined Execution:** Run [`/implement`](../implement/SKILL.md) per task slice test-first (Red-Green-Refactor). Review diffs against a fixed point before committing per [ADR-0010](../../../decisions/0010-git-history-replaces-the-master-log.md).
5. **Session Harvest & Closeout:** Run [`/chat-sync`](../chat-sync/SKILL.md) to harvest durable lessons, memories, and canon updates without wiping session history.

## Phase Boundaries & Context Management

A phase boundary is the transition point between two operational chunks (e.g. discovery -> implementation).

### The Five-Action Precedence Tree:

1. **Continue:** Stay in active session if the next phase requires verbatim history as a primary source and the token count is within the **smart zone** (below the selected model's live context warning).
2. **Fresh Session:** Open a new chat window when prior exploration context is disposable. Never run `/clear` (which permanently wipes history).
3. **`/session-handoff`:** Emit a portable briefing when changing providers or accounts inside Leonidas Code, switching directories, or handing off to collaborators.
4. **Subagent:** Dispatch an isolated background agent for autonomous, non-blocking tasks (e.g. test sweeps, diff audits).
5. **`/compact`:** Condense active context with an explicit retention instruction when smart zone limit is reached and session must continue in-place.

_For complete evaluation details, see [references/phase-boundaries.md](references/phase-boundaries.md)._

## Deterministic Zero-Token CLI Discovery

Query all AIOS skills and generate routing matrices directly from the terminal without spending LLM tokens:

```powershell
# Search skills by keyword
pwsh -File scripts/Find-SkillFlow.ps1 -Query "performance"

# Filter skills by operational category
pwsh -File scripts/Find-SkillFlow.ps1 -Category "Execution"

# Regenerate catalog matrix from live metadata
pwsh -File scripts/Find-SkillFlow.ps1 -GenerateMatrix
```

_(Script lives at [`scripts/Find-SkillFlow.ps1`](../../../scripts/Find-SkillFlow.ps1))._

---

## Disclosed Reference Modules

- **[`references/catalog-matrix.md`](references/catalog-matrix.md):** Skill classification matrix with invocation types, input/output contracts, and authoritative Mode bindings (generated; regenerate with `Find-SkillFlow.ps1 -GenerateMatrix`).
- **[`references/phase-boundaries.md`](references/phase-boundaries.md):** The 5-action boundary decision tree and primary vs. secondary source tradeoff analysis.
- **[`references/flow-taxonomies.md`](references/flow-taxonomies.md):** End-to-end multi-skill execution recipes across Discovery, Systems, Refactoring, and External Fallbacks.

---

## Done When

A routing request is complete when all three conditions are satisfied:

1. A definitive target skill or multi-skill execution pipeline is identified and announced.
2. The appropriate Mode binding is established per [`modes/router.md`](../../../modes/router.md).
3. Any required phase boundary transitions (Continue, Fresh Session, Handoff, Subagent, Compact) are explicitly declared.

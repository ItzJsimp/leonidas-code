# /code-simplify

A short entry point to `code-simplification`.

## Steps

1. **Find the target:** the recent changes, unless the user gives a wider scope.
2. **Load `code-simplification`** and follow it.
3. **Apply one simplification at a time.** Run the tests after each one. If a test fails, revert that change.
4. **Finish** with tests and the build passing and a clean diff.

## Done when

- Behavior is the same (tests pass), and each change made the code shorter or clearer.
